This is a GREAT job, and you have captured several important items about
your project, and I can see that there are a lot of things you have thought
through.

You can ALWAYS specify more.  Try to think in terms of "if someone else
were to code this project, what would they need to know about the way it
operates?  What information could I provide them so they can be successful
in the implementation?

Reminder: ANY time you see the word "shall" in a requirement, that needs to
be a NUMBERED requirement.  If it isn't a requirement, don't number it.
For example, your line under 5.3.1 has "should" so it should NOT have any
number.  Same with line 5.3.10.  Anything with "should" or "will" needs to
have a related numbered requirement above it, and can't be numbered.

See if you can add a few more requirements to this to provide more detail,
but you are very close.....


Otherwise, nice work!

So far for the semester:
Proposal:      5.0  out of  5.0  points
Requirements: 14.0  out of 15.0  points
Homework 1:    3.34 out of  3.34 points
Homework 2:    3.34 out of  3.34 points
Particip.:     1.5  out of  1.5  points
              27.18 out of 28.18 points = 96.45% which is an A

Keep it up!
